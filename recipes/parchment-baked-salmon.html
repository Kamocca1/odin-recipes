                <p>
                    Wrapping your salmon in parchment paper is a great way to
                    keep it moist and flavorful. Take it from reviewer Bibi who
                    says, "Don't be afraid to bake salmon in parchment. It's a
                    great method for keeping your expensive fish from drying out
                    if it's a minute or two too long in the oven." Make it a
                    meal with this curried cashew, pear, and grape salad on the
                    side.

                <ul>
                    <li>1 (8 ounce) salmon fillet</li>
                    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>Â¼ cup chopped basil leaves</li>
                    <li>olive oil cooking spray</li>
                    <li>1 lemon, thinly sliced</li>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Move
                        an oven rack to the lowest position.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place salmon fillet, skin-side down, in the middle of a
                        large piece of parchment paper; season with salt and
                        black pepper. Cut two 3-inch slits into fillet with a
                        sharp knife. Stuff chopped basil leaves into the slits.
                        Spray fillet with cooking spray and arrange lemon slices
                        on top.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fold the edges of parchment paper over fillet several
                        times to seal it into an airtight packet. Place sealed
                        packet onto a baking sheet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bake in the preheated oven on the bottom rack until
                        salmon flakes easily and flesh is pink and opaque with
                        an interior of slightly darker pink color, about 25
                        minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
                        thickest part of fillet should read at least 145 degrees
                        F (65 degrees C). To serve, cut open the parchment paper
                        and remove lemon slices before plating.
                    </li>
